# Deep-Learning-Specialization
Congratulations! You have completed all 5 courses of the Deep
Learning Specialization. In this Specialization, you built neural network
architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent
Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learned how to make
them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, and
Xavier/He initialization. You mastered these theoretical concepts,
learned their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow, and
tackled real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis,
chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.
You are now familiar with the capabilities and challenges of deep
learning. You are ready to take the definitive step in the world of AI
and participate in the development of leading-edge technology.
